    * [Julia2925](https://github.com/Beramos/DS-Julia2925)
    * Maybe you can find more recent Julia tutorials [here](https://pnavaro.github.io/NouvellesJulia/).
  * Take a look at the sections of [the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) that cover the fundamentals of the language (Getting Started, Variables, Integers..., Mathematical Operations..., Strings, Functions, Scope of Variables, Types and Methods).
  * Join the Julia [mailing list](https://listes.services.cnrs.fr/wws/subscribe/julia) from CNRS.
